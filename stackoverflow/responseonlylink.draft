## Code is all we use, but we need something more {#introduction}
{::comment}In this paragraph, give the user the tl;dr lowdown. {:/} 
You find and put a link in your answer. That's great, but you only write that.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
{::comment}In this section, detail why the post has problems{:/} 
Links goes down. If they redirect to an external page, the link can get broken. Beside that, maybe you linked to a whole library, where the answer is explained, but OP will have to dive into it to find it. Maybe the link is just a piece of code, but OP will have to understand it by itself.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
You take the time to put a link, that you have or find, and that is great, but you didn't do anything else to make the answer richier. For answers, we expect a little more of context and information, so future readers know what are you writing about.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
Don't take the link out. But copy the essencial parts of it into the answer. Explain how to solve the problem, or the important parts of the link to read. Leave it just for future references.

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
