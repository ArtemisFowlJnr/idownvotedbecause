## Code is all we use, but we need something more {#introduction}
{::comment}In this paragraph, give the user the tl;dr lowdown. {:/} Maybe you wrote a line, or 50, but we only see code. Code is what we need, but without knowing how it work, we can only copy and paste it, but will not work in the future.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
{::comment}In this section, detail why the post has problems{:/} Future readers will need to read the question, your code, and try to understand if that code will help them or not. maybe is a long function and trying to understand if all the code is a solution to a similar problem takes to long. Maybe is only one line, but is doing something very complex that will make reader to look for every part of the expression.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
You take the job to build a post, with your own code or copied from somewhere else, that's a great thing. But, to reach future readers and to understand what you did, it would be good to explain your code. If it has some weird functionality or something that is not common, if would be nice if you explain it.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
{::comment}In this section, cover how the problem can be fixed.{:/}
Explain your code. Explain what it does, how it does it, and if there are some obscure parts, explain them too. 

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
