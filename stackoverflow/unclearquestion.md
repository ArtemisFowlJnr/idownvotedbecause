## Before we can help you, you must help us {#introduction}
Sometimes questions aren't as clear to others as they could be or they may be missing critical information needed to provide a correct answer. When we submit a question it is up to us to ensure that the people reading it will have all of the information they need to help us with our issue.

- They may also be missing a clear and concise question. 
- The formatting may be extremely difficult to read.  
- The may be missing the code causing the problem and just contian the exception.
- They may include just code with out any error description.



## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Without a clear and concise question and a clear picture of the problem, it is less likely that the question will be answered.  Questions like this that do get anwsers tend to result in answers that are at best educated guesses and at worst completely wrong. The problem then results in other people seeking a solution for their problem, forced to navigate in a sea of unclear questions with presumably low-quality answers.

Do you think you are able to understand what are you asking?

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If a question is important enough to ask, it should be important enough to spend the time and energy on it that is needed. Any one reading the question is using their time in analyzing a question this may end up being wasted time. If someone attempts to answer a question like this and it that ends up being incorrect, the time spent on that is also wasted. Wasting the time of people who are trying to help is seen as rude.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Edit the question to clarify and make it understandable for anyone is reading it, and then @reply in the comments to let the people know that their requests for clarification have been answered. In the future, when asking a question, read your question at least twice before submitting it, considering the point of view of someone that does not have all the information that you have, but will have to reply only on the basis of what is written in your question. Remember to include a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example (MCVE). Use the formatting to make the question easily readable. Don't forget to check to see if comments or answers have been added every ten to fifteen minutes and always edit your question if someone raises a request for clarification. Doing so raises the chances they will provide an answer, as well as the probability that the answer is a correct solution, and it will become a solution also for someone else in future.
