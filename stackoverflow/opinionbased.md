## This question is mainly opinion based and open ended {#introduction}
Stack Overflow is for practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you or others may come up against. Chatty, open-ended questions do not belong on the site.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Chatty, open-ended questions make the site less productive, and make more useful, practical questions harder to find for others.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
This reduces the productiveness of the site, increasing the "noise to content" ration and making it harder to find answers to questions. As such it should be removed to make other, more important questions more accessible to both potential answerers and people with the same problem.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Please remove your question and find somewhere more appropriate to put it, perhaps a relevant room in [Stack Overflow chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/). When you have a question more fitting with SO's guidlines, please come back and ask it.
